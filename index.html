I want to propose a three point Manifesto that Governs the Communication between a Computer and its Programmer.
</p><p>
The Manifesto reads as follows:
<ul>
<li>A computer will be <i>polite</i> and <i>respectful</i> to its programmer.</li>
<li>A computer will speak to its programmer in the <i>natural language</i> of its programmer, and not in its own internal language of cryptic error messages and stack traces.</li>
<li>A computer will respond to the <i>intent</i> of its programmer, and not strictly to the <i>sequence</i> of <i>characters</i> entered by the programmer.</li>
</ul>
The first project in realizing this Manifesto is ml4debugging. The idea behind ml4debugging is to use a Machine Learning approach to translating the error messages of an interpreter or compiler into natural language. Specifically, within the field of Machine Learning, there is a subfield called Machine Translation, which uses computers to translate from one language another, such as from English to French or French to English.
</p><p>
We can use the same technology to think of the error message generated by a computer language interpreter, along with the line of code containing the error, as the "source" language, and the natural language description of the error message as the "target" language.  
</p><p>
An example:
</p><p>
This is the present error message of a Python interpreter in response to a fragment of Python code:<br><br>
<ipython-input-25-ab230ef80de6> in rnn_forward(x, a0, parameters)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp     47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp         # Append "cache" to "caches" (?1 line)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp     48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp         caches = np.append( caches, cache )<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp===> 49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp         print("cache.shape: " + str(cache.shape))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp     50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp         print("caches.shape: " + str(t) + " "+ str(caches.shape))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp     51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp     ### END CODE HERE ###<br>
<b>AttributeError:</b> 'tuple' object has no attribute 'shape'
<br><br>
And this is the correct message as it should be:<br>
Sandeep, I'm having a problem interpreting your code. I believe the problem is that in Line 49 of your code, the variable "cache" is of type "tuple", and a tuple cannot be referenced by a "shape" attribute. 
</p><p>
The idea is not necessarily to <i>replace</i> the error message or stack trace of the interpreter, but possibly to <i>supplement</i> it with a message in natural language.
</p><p>
You can see a more complete list of such message pairs at this link: <a href="https://ml4debugging.github.io/web/data.html">Present and Correct Message Pairs</a>.
</p><p>
The primary challenge in this project is to put together the training data that will be used to train the neural network, and I am still searching for a clever way to do it which does not make it necessary to hand-write all the message pairs.
</p><p>
Note: I came up with and first published this idea in 2018. As of 2022, there is indeed a clever way to put together the training data. That is using large scale text generation models such as <a href="https://www.eleuther.ai/">GPT-J and GPT-Neo by EleutherAI</a>.
